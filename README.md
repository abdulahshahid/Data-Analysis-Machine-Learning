## Why Pakistan is like this?

## Overview

Welcome to the Gapminder Data Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze and understand the socio-economic development of countries, focusing on Pakistan, using data provided by the Gapminder Foundation. The project explores various factors contributing to Pakistan's economic challenges despite 70 years of independence. By utilizing Python's Pandas library for data manipulation, Texttable for tabular representation, and data visualization techniques, we dive deep into the data to uncover insights and draw reasoned conclusions.

## About Gapminder Foundation

Gapminder Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Stockholm, Sweden, is dedicated to promoting sustainable global development and achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The foundation provides statistics and information about social, economic, and environmental development at local, national, and global levels.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze and understand the reasons behind Pakistan's continued economic challenges despite 70 years of independence. We aim to support our observations with data-driven reasoning and comparisons with other countries using various socio-economic factors.

## Data Source

The data used in this project was provided by Dr. Junaid, our course instructor, and originates from Gapminder Foundation. The data is in CSV format and spans 70 years, encompassing various socio-economic indicators for multiple countries.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python: The core programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Texttable: A library used for creating textual tables to present our findings.
- Data Visualization: Graphs and charts are used to visually represent the data and trends.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Loading: We load the Gapminder data in CSV format using the Pandas library.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and formatting.
3. Data Analysis: Exploring the data, identifying key indicators, and understanding trends.
4. Comparison: We compare Pakistan's economic indicators with those of other countries.
5. Visualization: Creating graphs and charts to visualize the data patterns.
6. Conclusion: Summarizing our observations and findings in a comprehensive report.

## How to Use the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas texttable`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided to perform the data analysis.
4. Explore the code and comments to understand the analysis process and reasoning.
5. Review the generated textual tables and visualizations to gain insights.

## Project Results

Our findings and insights from the data analysis are documented in a detailed report. We compare Pakistan's economic performance with that of various countries over the 70-year period, considering factors such as inflation, poverty, income per person, and more. The report presents a comprehensive analysis, highlighting the challenges and potential reasons for Pakistan's economic situation.
